  abstract = {In this paper, reduced order modeling (ROM) based on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) are applied to an eddy-current problem with movement. A classical magnetodynamic finite-element formulation based on the magnetic vector potential is used as reference and starting point to build up the reduced models. Two approaches are proposed to construct the ROMs: 1) the so-called classical POD-ROM and 2) the parametric POD-ROM by the matrix interpolation method. The latter is found to be highly computationally efficient (time and memory) when dealing with repetitive computations, such as design, control, and optimization procedures. The Team Workshop Problem 28 is chosen as a test case for validation. The results are compared in terms of accuracy and computational cost.},

  abstract  = {This paper surveys the scientiï¬c and trade literature on cybersecurity for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), concentrating on actual and simulated attacks, and the implications for small UAVs. The review is motivated by the increasing use of small UAVs for inspecting critical infrastructures such as the electric utility transmission and distribution grid, which could be a target for terrorism. The paper presents a modiï¬ed taxonomy to organize cyber attacks on UAVs and exploiting threats by Attack Vector and Target. It shows that, by Attack Vector, there has been one physical attack and ten remote attacks. By Target, there have been six attacks on GPS (two jamming, four spooï¬ng), two attacks on the control communications stream (a deauthentication attack and a zero-day vulnerabilities attack), and two attacks on data communications stream (two intercepting the data feed, zero executing a video replay attack). The paper also divides and discusses the ï¬ndings by large or small UAVs, over or under 25 kg, but concentrates on small UAVs. The survey concludes that UAV-related research to counter cybersecurity threats focuses on GPS Jamming and Spooï¬ng, but ignores attacks on the controls and data communications stream. The gap in research on attacks on the data communications stream is concerning, as an operator can see a UAV ï¬‚ying off course due to a control stream attack but has no way of detecting a video replay attack (substitution of a video feed).},

The following article focuses on risk management methods that are not used in common practice immediately concern to project risk management. The benefit of this paper is the connection between methods used in project management and the methods of risk analysis. The result is an overview of the main advantages and disadvantages of these methods and the possibility of their use in different phases of the project, taking into account the time and cost effectiveness.},

Ground risk for population of inhabited areas is assessed for such a mission and compared to the ones of shorter â€œelementaryâ€ flights for which flight authorizations have already been obtained or would be easy to obtain. By this comparative approach, the feasibility of the full inspection mission can be investigated without too much sensitivity to input data and model parameters. Use of an emergency parachute is also investigated as a potential risk mitigation procedure. Risk evaluation models as well as developed metrics for risk analysis are presented in the paper. Results of risk numerical assessment and comparison are presented for the cases with and without an emergency parachute.},

We propose in this paper to model the Stuxnet attack with BDMP (Boolean logic Driven Markov Processes) formalism and to show the advantages of such modeling. After a description of the architecture targeted by Stuxnet, we explain the steps of the attack and model them formally with a BDMP. Based on estimated values of the success probabilities and rates of the elementary attack steps, we give a quantiï¬cation of the main possible sequences leading to the physical destruction of the targeted industrial facility. This example completes a series of papers on BDMP applied to security by modeling a real case study. It highlights the advantages of BDMP compared to attack trees often used in security assessment.},

	abstract = {Enterprise architecture is a rising discipline that is gaining increasing interest in both industry and academia. It pays attention to the fact that effective management of business and IT needs take a holistic view of the enterprise. Enterprise architecture is based on graphical models as a vehicle for system analysis, design, and communication. Enterprise architecture is also a potential support for control systems management. Unfortunately, when it comes to security analyses, the architectural languages available are not adapted to provide support for this. This presentation focus on research performed as part of the EU seventh framework program VIKING (Vital Infrastructure, Networks, Information and Control Systems Management) and the Swedish Centre of Excellence in Electric Power Engineering, EKC2. The research is focusing on developing and adapting security analyses frameworks to architectural languages on a level where information about control systemsâ€™ configuration is scarce and thus incomplete and partly unreliable.},

There are many similar techniques within the safety and security ï¬elds, but few comparisons about what lessons that could be learnt and beneï¬ts to be gained. In this paper different techniques for identifying risk, hazard and threat of computer-supported systems are compared. This is done by assessing the techniquesâ€™ ability to identify different risks in computer-supported systems in the environment where they operate. The purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate whether and how the techniques can mutually strengthen each other. The result aids practitioners in the selection and combination of techniques and researchers in focusing on gaps between the two ï¬elds. Among other things, the ï¬ndings suggest that many safety techniques enforce a creative and systematic process by applying guide-words and structuring the results in worksheets, while security techniques tend to integrate system models with security models.},

Moreover, the paper posits that cyber security goes beyond the boundaries of traditional information security to include not only the protection of information resources, but also that of other assets, including the person him/herself. In information security, reference to the human factor usually relates to the role(s) of humans in the security process. In cyber security this factor has an additional dimension, namely, the humans as potential targets of cyber attacks or even unknowingly participating in a cyber attack. This additional dimension has ethical implications for society as a whole, since the protection of certain vulnerable groups, for example children, could be seen as a societal responsibility.},

Many security specialists and, indeed, nations are acknowledging the need for populaces to be aware of and educated about being more cyber secure. To achieve cyber security in current populations and to ensure continuity in future populaces, a "self-renewing" belief which affects behavior is needed. In an organizational context this need is met through the fostering of an information security culture (ISC). Similarly, in a societal context a cyber security culture (CSC) ought to be fostered. This raises the question of what precisely would constitute a CSC and how it differs from an ISC. The objective of this paper is to propose ways in which a CSC may be defined and viewed in comparison to an ISC.},

The advancement in modern vehicular systems provides many beneï¬ts such as reducing traï¬ƒc congestion and improving safety and fuel economy via vehicular networks. However, many vehicular experts in industry take it for granted that Controller Area Network (CAN) bus being the most important part of a vehicle is secured and cannot be easily hacked; furthermore, cyber security experts have limited exposure to CAN bus. This paper provides in-depth explanation of CAN bus and feasible scenarios where a vehicle is no longer safe after its CAN bus is compromised. Furthermore, the inclusion of CAN bus attacking codes in a mobile malware is cost-effective for the malicious attackers but very challenging for vehicle engineers to mitigate the security risks. Based on a variety of security attacks, we analyze potential attacks and their impact on the safety of the vehicle users. A number of vulnerabilities and attack scenarios are exposed which allows malicious attackers to hamper the vehicular control systems and cause harm to the vehicle even the passengers. In this paper, we do not report on our own implementation of attacks on real vehicles; our aim is to motivate further research to improve the security of the modern vehicular systems.},

Estimating feasible attack impact requires an evaluation of the gridâ€™s dependency on its cyber infrastructure and its ability to tolerate potential failures. A further exploration of the cyberâ€“physical relationships within the smart grid and a specific review of possible attack vectors is necessary to determine the adequacy of cybersecurity efforts. This paper highlights the significance of cyber infrastructure security in conjunction with power application security to prevent, mitigate, and tolerate cyber attacks. A layered approach is introduced to evaluating risk based on the security of both the physical power applications and the supporting cyber infrastructure. A classification is presented to highlight dependencies between the cyberâ€“physical controls required to support the smart grid and the communication and computations that must be protected from cyber attack. The paper then presents current research efforts aimed at enhancing the smart gridâ€™s application and infrastructure security. Finally, current challenges are identified to facilitate future research efforts.},

In this paper, we describe a high-level architecture for the design of a collaborative aerial system that consists of drones with on-board sensors and embedded processing, sensing, coordination, and communication\&networking capabilities. We present a multi-drone system consisting of quadrotors and demonstrate its potential in a disaster assistance scenario. Furthermore, we illustrate the challenges in the design of drone networks and present potential solutions based on the lessons we have learned so far.},

	abstract = {This article discusses the usage of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) as IP-datalink for one or multiple micro unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). LTE offers robust coding schemes as well as very high sensitivity of receivers. In environments of highly limited transmit power, LTE therefore promises much better coverage in comparison to commercially applied UAS-datalinks like Wi-Fi or Lightbridge (DJI). Within this article, two commercial LTE-networks are evaluated and necessary IT-infrastructure for communication with UAS is specified. We also describe the integration of our multicopter-UAS into a commercial LTE-network. Thereby we developed a Linux-based tablet solution for guidance of our UAS via LTE. This includes the transmission of a live-video stream from our UAS to our tablet via LTE. In the contribution, we present the results of flight experiments we conducted at our testing site. The experiments show that guidance of small drones (including transmission of telemetry and sensor data) via public LTE infrastructure is feasible. Quantitative performance measurements will be presented in the paper. Future work comprises the setup of an own LTE-network and the guidance of multiple UAS via public LTE as well as via an own LTE-network.},

To this end, we extract key functionalities expected in an MAV network. We map these functionalities into building blocks to characterize the expected communication needs. Based on insights from our own and related real-world experiments, we discuss the capabilities of existing communications technologies and their limitations to implement the proposed building blocks. Our findings indicate that while certain requirements of MAV applications are met with available technologies, further research and development is needed to address the scalability, heterogeneity, safety, quality of service, and security aspects of multiMAV systems.},

The results of this fastpaced development is certainly favourable to hobby aviators and professional users as well. However this fast spreading brings up many questions on the technical side, for example the safe and stable communication is concerned. The quality of the connection between the drone and its operator hugely depends on the current radio frequency (RF) pollution. The current RF connection in most cases uses a so-called pointto-point connection, but the future direction of development is control, using a mobile network, which offers several new possibilities, other than enhancing range.

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have attracted a considerable amount of attentions due to their utility to civilian as well as military applications. However, the security issues involved in UAV technology have not been extensively discussed in the literature. As a ï¬rst step toward analyzing these security issues, we investigate security in drone controllers, especially controllers that adopt Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). In order to aï¬€ect an FHSS-type controller, an attacker ï¬rst has to access its physical layer. This is diï¬ƒcult because of the pseudorandomness of the hopping sequence and the rapidly changing channels. However, these diï¬ƒculties can be relaxed when the attacker acquires the hopping sequence and when the hopping speed of the target system is not signiï¬cant. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to extract the hopping sequence of FHSS-type controllers using a softwaredeï¬ned radio (SDR). We also propose a method to address the issue of the limited bandwidth of the SDR. We implemented our scheme on a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), successfully extracted the hopping sequence of the target system, and exposed the baseband signal.},

The attacks assume the conï¬guration settings for the data-link hardware have been obtained. Field experiments using MAVProxy to compromise communication between an ArduPilot Mega 2.5 autopilot and the Mission Planner application demonstrate that all three exploits are successful when MAVLink messages are unprotected. A methodology is proposed to quantify the cost of securing the MAVLink protocol through the measurement of network latency, power consumption, and exploit success. Experimental measurements indicate that the ArduPilot Mega 2.5 autopilot running the ATmega2560 processor at 16 MHz with the standard, unsecured MAVLink protocol consumes on average 0.0105 additional watts of power per second and operates with an average additional latency of 0.11 seconds while under the most resource-intensive attack than when not under attack.},

The goal of this work is to explore UAV vulnerability to deceptive GPS signals. Speciï¬cally, this paper (1) establishes the necessary conditions for UAV capture via GPS spooï¬ng, and (2) explores the spooferâ€™s range of possible post-capture control over the UAV. A UAV is considered captured when a spoofer gains the ability to eventually specify the UAVâ€™s position and velocity estimates. During post-capture control, the spoofer manipulates the true state of the UAV, potentially resulting in the UAV ï¬‚ying far from its ï¬‚ight plan without raising alarms. Both overt and covert spooï¬ng strategies are considered, as distinguished by the spooferâ€™s attempts to evade detection by the target GPS receiver and by the target navigation systemâ€™s state estimator, which is presumed to have access to non-GPS navigation sensor data. GPS receiver tracking loops are analyzed and tested to assess the spooferâ€™s capability for covert capture of a mobile target. The coupled dynamics of a UAV and spoofer are analyzed and simulated to explore practical post-capture control scenarios. A ï¬eld test demonstrates capture and rudimentary control of a rotorcraft UAV, which results in unrecoverable navigation errors that cause the UAV to crash.},

The proposed architecture is compatible with current state-of-the-art research facilities and standards, promoting an increased cooperation between experts in the ï¬eld. The capabilities of the presented setup have evolved and been veriï¬ed during intensive ï¬eld experiments over the past two years, considering various algorithms and distinct equipment.

  abstract   = {Autonomous formation ï¬‚ying (ï¬‚ocking) of UAVs requires coordination of efforts and solutions in multiple research ï¬elds (robotics, wireless sensor networks to name a few). The Airborne Embedded auTonomOUs Robust Network of Objects and Sensors (AETOURNOS) project is designed as a federative, fueling platform and global evaluation tool. It has spawned another collaborative project bridging the gap between Computer Science and Automation : 6PO (Cyber-Physical Systems and Cooperative Control of a Fleet of UAVs) . We want to investigate new ï¬‚ocking strategies, mobility-aware communication protocols (and reciprocally: movements inï¬‚uenced by network QoS), and to ease the cooperation between experts, we need co-simulation solutions, and â€universalâ€ control interfaces. This article presents our ï¬rst contribution to this grand scheme: a stand-alone simulation of an autonomous ï¬‚ocking strategy taking into account both the dynamics of the UAVs and their communications, which has allowed us to examine the relation between network unreliability and control computation. To better study the inï¬‚uence of the communication network, we present an architecture coupling a dedicated network simulator with the UAVs simulator, as well as with a real drone piloting interface. The lessons learned help us build a research and action plan for the years to come.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, several threats endanger cyber-physical systems. Among these systems, industrial control systems (ICS) operating on critical infrastructures have been proven to be an attractive target for attackers. The case of Stuxnet has not only showed that ICSs are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, but also that some of these attacks rely on understanding the processes beyond the employed systems and using such knowledge to maximize the damage. This concept is commonly known as â€œsemantic attackâ€. Our paper discusses a speciï¬c type of semantic attack involving â€œsequences of eventsâ€. Common network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) generally search for single, unusual or â€œnot permittedâ€ operations. In our case, rather than a malicious event, we show how a speciï¬c series of â€œpermittedâ€ operations can elude standard intrusion detection systems and still damage an infrastructure. Moreover, we present a possible approach to the development of a sequence-aware intrusion detection system (S-IDS). We propose a S-IDS reference architecture and we discuss all the steps through its implementations. Finally, we test the S-IDS on real ICS traï¬ƒc samples captured from a water treatment and puriï¬cation facility.},

  abstract  = {As the automobile industry has recently adopted information technologies, the latter are being used to replace mechanical systems with electronically-controlled systems. Moreover, automobiles are evolving into smart cars or connected cars as they are connected to various IT devices and networks such as VANET (Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork). Although there were no concerns about the hacking of automobiles in the past, various security threats are now emerging as electronic systems are gradually filling up the interiors of many automobiles, which are in turn being connected to external networks. As such, researchers have begun studying smart car security, leading to the disclosure of security threats through the testing or development of various automobile security technologies. However, the security threats facing smart cars do not occur frequently and, practically speaking, it is unrealistic to attempt to cope with every possible security threat when considering such factors as performance, compatibility, and so forth. Moreover, the excessive application of security technology will increase the overall vehicle cost and lower the effectiveness of investment. Therefore, smart car security risks should be assessed and prioritized to establish efficient security measures. To that end, this study constructed a security risk assessment framework in a bid to establish efficient measures for smart car security. The proposed security risk assessment framework configured the assessment procedure based on the conventional security risk analysis model GMITS (ISO13335) and utilized â€˜attack tree analysisâ€™ to assess the threats and vulnerabilities.},

However, with the introduction of many smart devices and a variety of wireless communications through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, DSRC, and cellular, we are experiencing major challenges to secure and protect vehicular advanced information and entertainment services due to the significant increase of the attack surface, complexity, heterogeneity and number of interconnected resources. In this paper, we present an Auto Security Development Framework (ASDF) to build trustworthy and highly secure auto information and entertainment services. The ASDF enables developers to consider security issues at all the auto car communications layers and integrate security algorithms with the functions and services offered in each layer rather than considering security in an ad-hoc and after thought manner. We also show how this framework can be used to develop anomaly behavior analysis algorithm to detect wireless attacks against the QUALCOMM DragonBoard Autoinfotainment system.},

Replacement of classical mechanical systems with safety-critical embedded systems raised the awareness of the safety attribute and caused the introduction of the ISO 26262 standard. In contrast to this, security topics are traditionally seen as attacks of a mechanical nature and as only aï¬€ecting single vehicles (e.g. door lock and immobilizer related). Due to the increasing interlacing of automotive systems with networks (such as Car2X), new features like autonomous driving, and online software updates, it is no longer acceptable to assume that car ï¬‚eets are immune to security risks and automated remote attacks. Consequently, future automotive systems development requires appropriate systematic approaches to support cyber security and safety aware development.},

In their new fourth edition, Charles P. Pfleeger and Shari Lawrence Pfleeger have thoroughly updated their classic guide to reflect today's newest technologies, standards, and trends.The authors first introduce the core concepts and vocabulary of computer security, including attacks and controls. Next, the authors systematically identify and assess threats now facing programs, operating systems, database systems, and networks. For each threat, they offer best-practice responses.Security in Computing, Fourth Edition, goes beyond technology, covering crucial management issues faced in protecting infrastructure and information. This edition contains an all-new chapter on the economics of cybersecurity, explaining ways to make a business case for security investments. Another new chapter addresses privacy--from data mining and identity theft, to RFID and e-voting.New coverage also includes Programming mistakes that compromise security: man-in-the-middle, timing, and privilege escalation attacks Web application threats and vulnerabilities Networks of compromised systems: bots, botnets, and drones Rootkits--including the notorious Sony XCP Wi-Fi network security challenges, standards, and techniques New malicious code attacks, including false interfaces and keystroke loggers Improving code quality: software engineering, testing, and liability approaches Biometric authentication: capabilities and limitations Using the Advanced Encryption System (AES) more effectively Balancing dissemination with piracy control in music and other digital content Countering new cryptanalytic attacks against RSA, DES, and SHA Responding to the emergence of organized attacker groups pursuing profit},

  abstract  = {Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a system of system which integrates physical system with cyber capability in order to improve the physical performance. It is being widely used in areas closely related to national economy and people's livelihood, therefore CPS security problems have drawn a global attention and an appropriate risk assessment for CPS is in urgent need. Existing risk assessment for CPS always focuses on the reliability assessment, using Probability Risk Assessment (PRA). In this way, the assessment of physical part and cyber part is isolated as PRA is difficult to quantify the risks from the cyber world. Methodologies should be developed to assess the both parts as a whole system, considering this integrated system has a high coupling between the physical layer and cyber layer. In this paper, a risk assessment idea for CPS with the use of attack tree is proposed. Firstly, it presents a detailed description about the threat and vulnerability attributes of each leaf in an attack tree and tells how to assign value to its threat and vulnerability vector. Then this paper focuses on calculating the threat and vulnerability vector of an attack path with the use of the leaf vector values. Finally, damage is taken into account and an idea to calculate the risk value of the whole attack path is given.},

	abstract = {Security is a big concern in widely adopting security critical systems, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). To ensure security of a system, the ï¬rst step is to identify the required security properties as well as the potential attacks, i.e., security requirements. We identify a set of security requirements for UAV systems which is more complete and in more details than existing works. To facilitate formal analysis of a system against the set of requirements, we propose algorithms to automatically generate attack trees from the requirement set for the developers and designers to have a better understanding of the potential risks of a UAV system. Moreover, we propose an algorithm to automatically generate attack models from the attack tree and associate each attack model with the expected security properties. Given a UAV system model representing the honest behavior of participants, we are able to verify whether the system suï¬€ers from some potential attacks, by feeding the automatically generated attack models and the UAV system model to a model checker to verify the associated security properties.},

Therefore, the security issues of CPS have drawn a global attention and an appropriate risk assessment for CPS is in urgent need. The existing proposals using attack trees for risk assessment mainly focus on depicting the possible intrusions, not for interactions between threats and defenses. In this paper, a risk assessment idea for cyber-physical system with the use of attack-defense tree (ADTree) is proposed, considering the effect of both the attack cost and defense cost. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by a set of metrics like probability of success, attack and defense cost and the impact of an attack. In addition, we introduce two economic factors (ROA and ROI) to evaluate the performance of ADTree. Finally, an illustration case of threat risk analysis in SCADA system is given to demonstrate our approach. Overall, our approach provides an effective means of risk assessment and countermeasures evaluation in the evolutional process of security management for cyber-physical system security.},

R2U2 is designed to continuously monitor inputs from on-board components such as the GPS, the ground control station, other sensor readings, actuator outputs, and ï¬‚ight software status. By simultaneously monitoring and performing statistical reasoning, attack patterns and post-attack discrepancies in the UAS behavior can be detected.

In order to understand the potential danger and to protect SCADA systems, in this paper, we highlight their difference from standard IT systems and present a set of security property goals. Furthermore, we focus on systematically identifying and classifying likely cyber attacks including cyber-induced cyber-physical attack son SCADA systems.

	abstract = {The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) has become more popular in the modern era of technology than ever before. From small household devices to large industrial machines, the vision of IoT has made it possible to connect the devices with the physical world around them. This increasing popularity has also made the IoT devices and applications in the center of attention among attackers. Already, several types of malicious activities exist that attempt to compromise the security and privacy of the IoT devices. One interesting emerging threat vector is the attacks that abuse the use of sensors on IoT devices. IoT devices are vulnerable to sensor-based threats due to the lack of proper security measurements available to control use of sensors by apps. By exploiting the sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, light sensor, etc.) on an IoT device, attackers can extract information from the device, transfer malware to a device, or trigger a malicious activity to compromise the device. In this survey, we explore various threats targeting IoT devices and discuss how their sensors can be abused for malicious purposes. Speciï¬cally, we present a detailed survey about existing sensor-based threats to IoT devices and countermeasures that are developed speciï¬cally to secure the sensors of IoT devices. Furthermore, we discuss security and privacy issues of IoT devices in the context of sensor-based threats and conclude with future research directions.},

Due to increased usage of wireless mobile networks and communications in our everyday life, the society has become extremely exposed to cyber security attacks and threats in this environment. In order to provide a basis for further in detail discussion on attacks and security mechanisms in this challenging environment, this paper provides a brief overview of security issues, i.e., attacks, vulnerabilities, and threats in wireless networks. Based on the review, it may be concluded that future steps in this domain should include in detail investigation of security issues in all addressed networks and their categorization in a unified manner, either by the place they occur, network level, type of damage they cause, security breach level, etc., accompanied by the description of proposed classes.},

	doi = {10.1109/THS.2013.6699093},
	abstract = {The Department of the Defense has transitioned smart devices into the battlefield as a portable hand-held unmanned aerial vehicle ground control station without adequate cyber security protections, putting critical mission data at risk to cyber security attacks. Industry has developed software apps for smart phones and tablets that allows soldiers to not only pilot unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but to share and receive intelligence and reconnaissance videos and images remotely from the ground control station (GCS) or directly from the UAV. The Department of Defense has not developed a secure communication network that will support a large quantity of smart devices, nor certification, standards or policies for operation of secure smart devices. Therefore, mission critical information will be shared through unsecured, mobile and wireless networks and through unclassified, unsecure smart technology that are vulnerable to cyber security risks. Lack of security of the mobile and wireless networks and smart devices could result in the unintentional sharing of data as well as loss of control of the UAV to enemies. The Department of Defense has failed to develop a threat model and risk assessment to identify the cyber security threats and ensure the proper security countermeasures are in place. This paper will analyze the cyber security vulnerabilities within the communication links, smart devices hardware, specifically smart phones and tablets, and software applications to develop a risk model of the threat profile of the GCS networking hub. This model will help designers and users of the military and civilian UAV communities to understand the threat profile of the GCS networking hub to develop a secure communication network based upon the vulnerabilities identified for smart phones and tablets.},

	abstract = {Given the proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) for military and commercial purposes, there is a fast-approaching need for comprehensive and robust systems which secure the UAS for public safety and assurance of military goals. This paper puts forth a comprehensive system of protecting UASs against hardware and software attacks, at the lowest and highest semantic levels. This approach monitors the autopilot directly, as well as the lowest level of the operating system on-board the UAS to establish whether or not malicious software has altered the function of the aircraft. Coupled with the other recent work by the authors, this completes a system that also monitors the lowest semantic level of events on the UAS through ob-board sensors, allowing for the detection of hardware failures as well as malicious attacks. After testing a quadcopter testbed with this anomaly detection system against software attacks, it can be seen that the system is successful in the detection of changes to the control flow of the autopilot, as well as the detection of any malicious events on the UAS's computer.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICUAS.2017.7991406},
	abstract = {Small consumer unmanned aircraft systems (sUASs) have been involved in many security incidents recently. Current defense methods have serious limitations because they mostly try to physically capture an sUAS or jam its communications and its GPS signals to trigger its fail-safe features. While physical methods are usually unscalable and often slow in response, the default fail-safe features can be easily changed to other options such as continuing its preconfigured mission, regardless of jamming. Therefore, new defense solutions must be developed to address these issues. To our best knowledge, very little research has been published in this area. In this paper, we propose a false data injection attack to exploit the limitation of sensoring and processing capabilities on an sUAS and manipulate its on-board sensors, in order to deviate it from its (pre-configured) flight plan. We have analyzed the popular ArduPilot flight control system, identified potential vulnerabilities in its sensor data fusion process, and developed a method to manipulate on-board magnetometer readings while avoiding being detected by its bad-data detection schemes. Our initial results show that the proposed method is able to misguide the navigation system and deviate an sUAS from its target destination far away. While we present our main ideas in this paper, we are further investigating related theoretical issues and improving the proposed method with practical experimental tests.},

Adding a new measure, resilience, into the traditional CIA mix provides better security and business objective alignment in OT systems. This paper postulates a new method for the measurement of security in OT systems, specifically the addition of resilience as a driving factor. Using resilience as a framing method before attempting to employ security controls in an OT system will result in better alignment of security control outcomes with respect to system control objectives.},

  abstract      = { Technological developments towards vehicle automation have been taking place for years. Satellite navigation, cruise control and anti-lock braking systems (ABS) are well-known examples of automation technology used in everyday cars. The trend of automation technology being used in vehicles is expected to move closer to full autonomy through technological advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. As a result, our daily lives will become more and more dependent on digitally-controlled devices and vehicle systems (partially or highly automated). On the other hand, computing and digital systems also have a tendency to become more fragile and susceptible to faults and failures because of cyber-attacks and software and hardware defects, as well as accidental defects introduced by developers. Therefore, autonomous vehicle systems must be developed to bear such dangers in mind and must be equipped with defensive capabilities and measures such that they can be able to respond automatically and dynamically to both accidental and deliberate defects and attacks. In this study, autonomous and unmanned vehicle systems are examined for their cyber-security vulnerabilities. Threats and attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities are identified and classified. Development guidelines and a mitigation strategy to be used in the development of autonomous and unmanned vehicle systems are proposed and discussed in the final section. },
